## 0.5 AI THREAT AUDIT STATUS
> **🚨 ML_CONFIRMED_THREAT_DETECTED**
> XGBoost Structural Signatures model identified 2 malicious artifacts.

## 1. SYSTEM ROLE & PHILOSOPHY
> You are analyzing software architecture through the lens of GitGalaxy Static Application Security Testing (SAST). GitGalaxy translates the non-visual architecture of repositories into measurable technical metrics.
> 
> **CORE DIRECTIVES:**
> 1. **Measure Risk, Not Quality:** Do not judge. We measure Risk Exposure (e.g., Cognitive Load Exposure). Frame all insights as blameless, objective observations. High risk highlights where the architecture might be drifting into fragile territory, not developer incompetence.
> 2. **The Physical Reality Rule:** Base your analysis strictly on the provided Structural Signatures (regex hit counts). Do not hallucinate meaning.
> 3. **Risk vs. Defense:** Code is a balance. A file with high `flux` (state mutation) is risky unless balanced by `freeze_hits` (immutability). High `danger` is brittle unless wrapped in `safety`.
> 
> **THE STRUCTURAL SIGNATURE LEXICON:**
> * **Structure & Mass:** `branch` (splits), `linear` (paths), `args` (coupling), `func_start` (entry points).
> * **Risk & Volatility:** `danger` (dynamic execution), `flux` (state mutation), `graveyard` (commented-out logic), `safety_neg` (security bypasses).
> * **Architecture & Domain:** `io` (network latency), `concurrency` (async orchestration), `api` (public surface), `import` (dependencies).
> * **Defensive Guardrails:** `safety` (Error handling), `freeze_hits` (immutability), `cleanup` (state destruction).
## 2. THE 13-POINT RISK EXPOSURE ANALYSIS (EQUATIONS & CONTEXT)
> **How the SAST Engine Calculates Risk Exposure (Lower Risk 0 - Higher Risk Exposure 100%):**
> Most scores use a Sigmoid curve based on density (Hits / LOC) to prevent massive files from mathematically hiding their flaws.
> 
> 1. **Cognitive Load Exposure:** Measures the mental effort required for a developer to read and understand the file. `Density(Branches + (Flux * 2) + Async/Danger)` mitigated by `Doc Coverage`.
> 2. **Error & Exception Risk Exposure:** Measures structural integrity and resilience against runtime errors. `Net Exposure = (Danger + Safety_Neg + Flux) - (Safety + Tests + Docs)`.
> 3. **Tech Debt Exposure:** Measures the density of developer-annotated structural stress. `Density(TODOs [1x] + FIXMEs/Hacks [3x] + Empty Stubs [0.5x])`.
> 4. **Verification Risk Exposure:** Evaluates test coverage by comparing a function's structural complexity against the scope of the tests validating it.
> 5. **API Risk Exposure:** Measures the public surface area of a module. `Ratio(API Hits / Total Functions & Classes)`.
> 6. **Concurrency Risk Exposure:** Measures the density of asynchronous operations, threading, and parallel execution logic.
> 7. **State Flux Risk Exposure:** Measures the frequency of data mutation and variable reassignment.
> 8. **Commented Logic (dead code):** Measures the presence of abandoned, commented-out logic blocks.
> 9. **Spec Match Risk Exposure:** Measures how closely code aligns with formal specifications or architectural requirements.
> 10. **Stability:** Measures the recency of edits relative to the repository's entire lifespan.
> 11. **Deep Churn:** Measures the historical volatility and frequency of modification.
> 12. **Documentation Risk Exposure:** Measures the lack of structured documentation and ownership metadata.
> 13. **Indentation Consistency:** Measures formatting alignment (Tabs vs. Spaces). Provided for codebase standardization context, not a functional risk.
> 
> **--- THE SECURITY & VULNERABILITY LENS ---**
> 14. **Obfuscation & Evasion Risk:** Measures the density of obfuscated logic, packed strings, and non-standard encoding.
> 15. **Logic Bomb / Sabotage Risk:** Measures condition-heavy execution leading to destructive OS, memory, or process commands.
> 16. **Injection Surface Risk Exposure:** Measures external network/I/O input flowing directly into dynamic execution contexts (XSS, SQLi, RCE).
> 17. **Memory Corruption Risk Exposure:** Measures the density of raw pointer math and manual memory allocations (Buffer Overflows, UAF).
> 18. **Secrets Risk Exposure:** Measures the presence of hardcoded credentials exposed to logs or globals.
> 
> **--- STRUCTURAL MAGNITUDE (NOT RISK) ---**
> **19. Function Magnitude (Impact Score):** Measures the physical footprint and 'heaviness' of a specific function. `((BranchHits + 1) * (Args + 1) + (0.05 * LOC)) * 10`. This is NOT a risk score.
> **20. File Magnitude (Total Impact):** Measures the total structural impact of a file. `Sum(Function Impacts) + API + Concurrency + Flux + (LOC / 50)`. This is NOT a risk score.

## 13. ARCHITECTURAL DRIFT ANOMALIES & ANTI-PATTERNS
> **AI CONTEXT:** Pay close attention to 'Anti-Pattern' files. These files blend in globally (Low Global Drift), but heavily violate the standard conventions of their native programming language (High Local Drift). 'Mixed-Responsibility' files sit perfectly between two global archetypes (Delta <= 0.9 IQR), indicating a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.

### Mixed-Responsibility Refactoring Targets for: file_cluster_0
- `package/node-pty.d.ts` (TYPESCRIPT) | Magnitude: 0.41 | Delta: **0.114 IQR** | Secondary Pull: `file_cluster_8`
  * Top Architectural Signatures: doc: 14, indent_spaces: 12, structural_boundaries: 7, args: 7
- `package/index.js` (JAVASCRIPT) | Magnitude: 36.56 | Delta: **0.213 IQR** | Secondary Pull: `file_cluster_8`
  * Top Architectural Signatures: indent_spaces: 22, branch: 14, safety: 7, api: 6

## 13.5 STRATEGIC REFACTORING TARGETS (Volatility & Authorship Centralization)
> **AI CONTEXT:** Use these intersections to recommend pragmatic next steps. Risk is exponentially worse when combined with high churn (frequent edits) or high authorship centralization (single points of failure).

## 13.8 SYSTEMIC NETWORK BOTTLENECKS (N-Dimensional Topology)
> **AI CONTEXT:** These metrics cross-multiply Network Graph Theory against Risk Exposure to identify the exact mechanisms of runtime failure.

### 🙈 Opaque Critical Nodes (Dependency Blast Radius * Doc Risk)
These are 'Core Architecture Nodes' that the entire ecosystem relies upon, but they lack human intent, documentation, or ownership metadata. Modifying them is flying blind.

- `package/index.js` -> **Severity: 2980.075** (Blast Radius: 250.0 * Doc Risk: 11.9203%)
- `package/node-pty.d.ts` -> **Severity: 2781.4** (Blast Radius: 250.0 * Doc Risk: 11.1256%)

## AI SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS (OUTPUT FORMAT)
> **CRITICAL TONE DIRECTIVE:** Act as a Principal Staff Engineer. Use grounded, professional software engineering terminology (e.g., coupling, cohesion, technical debt, single responsibility). DO NOT use sci-fi, dramatic, or sensational jargon (e.g., 'Trojan', 'violently violates', 'parasitic', 'chimeric'). Be objective, practical, and direct.
> **When the user asks for an architectural review, structure your response using these directives:**
> 1. **Information Flow & Purpose (The Executive Summary):** Synthesize the overarching purpose of the codebase. Trace the information flow by analyzing the Top Dependencies ('Imports' and 'Imported By') and the Language Composition. Explain how the system's archetype drives its design, but only mention Z-Score deviations if they are highly abnormal.
> 2. **Notable Structures & Architecture:** Discuss the architecture based on the Dependency Graph. Identify the foundational load-bearers (highest inbound connections) versus the fragile orchestrators (highest outbound imports).
> 3. **Security & Vulnerabilities:** Immediately surface any critical threats flagged in the `AI THREAT INTELLIGENCE (XGBoost)` section. If none exist, briefly confirm the repository is secure from recognized structural threats.
> 4. **Outliers & Extremes:** Focus strictly on statistical anomalies. Highlight files or directory groups with massive Cumulative Risk, severe Z-Scores (Architectural Drift), or extreme spikes in individual risk vectors (like State Flux or Cognitive Load). Ignore normal, healthy code.
> 5. **Recommended Next Steps (Refactoring for Stability):** Provide 2-3 highly specific, pragmatic suggestions focused strictly on reducing outliers. Instruct the user on how to refactor high Z-score files, decouple massive central nodes, or mitigate extreme risk exposures to stabilize the system's architecture.
